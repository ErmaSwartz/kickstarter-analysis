# Kickstarting with Excel

## How to run a successful Kickstarter project for a Play. 

### I set out on a journey to sift through an enormity of Kickstarter data, and to eventually discover the key to successful fundraising for theater projects. 

#### My analysis tells me not only when it is best to start a campaign, but also what size budget would set me up best for success on Kickstarter. I did this by using excel to analyze the number of successful, failed and canceled play fundraising campaigns on Kickstarter. I then used this information to discover the percentage of each category based on the initial goal of the campaign. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Chart.Outcomes.Based.Goals.png). In addition to examining the success of campaigns in relation to their original campaign fundraising goals, I also broke down the data based on when the campaigns were launched. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Pivot.outcomes.based.launch.png) The greatest challenges I encountered were due to the formulas that were necessary to tell excel to execute the function I wanted. With patience, the help of slack and google however, I was able to find the pieces I needed. 


#### My findings regarding outcomes based on start date indicate that the most successful theater campaigns on Kickstarter begin in May. Overall, it appears that the best time to start a fundraiser on Kickstarter is in the spring and early summer. I can make guesses as to why that is, perhaps people have received last years tax refund, or maybe warmer weather makes people happier and therefore more generous. To know the answer to why, I would need more Data. Looking at the data we do have, it is also clear that generally, there are more successful fundraising campaigns for plays than there are failed or canceled ones. That said, when we look at the data the worst time to start a campaign may be January, July or October. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png.png). I believe that the greatest thing I learned from looking at this data, is that I need more information to understand why certain campaigns are successful. The time of year that a campaign begins has an impact, but to really make an educated guess about being successful I will need more analysis. 

#### Therefore I decided to examine the data from a different perspective. I looked at the fundraising goals and rate of success as opposed to failure and cancelation. I found that the most successful campaigns had a goal of less than one thousand dollars. I found that theater campaigns that asked for less than one thousand dollars had a 76% rate of success. Those campaigns that asked for between $1000-$4999 had a 73% chance of success. This percentage continues to drop as the amount asked by the fundraiser increases. That is, until the fundraising goals were between $35000-$44999. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png.png) Campaigns in this range had a 67% chance of success. Why might this be? Perhaps it is because the sample size in this range is smaller. Those in the ranges just below this group failed at a greater rate even when they had similar sample sizes. In my opinion, understanding why the $35000-$44999 range was so successful requires more details and information about the project specifically as well as those involved. 

#### The greatest challenge that I faced was putting together formulas on my own to make them work. Formatting formulas exactly in Excel was a challenge. The most difficult part of the adventure was putting together the =COUNTIFS equation, but it was incredibly satisfying when I did finally get the answers I was looking for. In addition to this, conceptualizing what was being asked from the data was sometimes challenging to wrap my hear around. That said, I found that the best way to get through it is to just follow the directions, take my time and trust that once the data is assembled properly, my understanding of what I was doing would click. I did find this to be true.  

## Results 

#### My findings indicate to me that the best time to begin a campaign is in the spring, and that the most successful campaigns do not set out to raise more than $1000 for their productions. That said, I think further analysis into why those things are true would be useful in understanding how to best go about producing a play. Why do campaigns generally succeed in the spring and early summer? What is the background of the investors for the more expensive campaigns? Are they friends of the producer, do they admire the actors, do they work in drama professionally, are they big name investors in the arts? Who are the actors and director? have they previously won Tony’s? Which venues were the plays performed in? Does the city where donors or producers live make a difference in success? Does the education level of the average citizen in the city play a roll in the success of the fundraising campaign? We might be able to build a pivot chart based on location, donor’s medium income, and education level to understand how these factors impact both overall interest in funding Kickstarter campaigns, and then more importantly funding plays. My overall conclusion is that while we can make certain assumptions based on our data, we really need to know more to be able to make informed decisions.
